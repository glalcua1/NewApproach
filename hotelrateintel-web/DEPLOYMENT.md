# Deployment Guide for HotelRateIntel

## ðŸš€ Vercel Deployment Fix

The 404 error on your Vercel deployment is now fixed with the added `vercel.json` configuration.

### What was causing the 404:
- React Router uses client-side routing
- Vercel was trying to serve routes like `/dashboard` as actual files
- Without proper configuration, it returned 404 for any route except `/`

### What the fix does:
- Routes all requests to `index.html` so React Router can handle them
- Properly serves static assets with caching headers
- Ensures build artifacts are correctly mapped

## ðŸ“‹ Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Redeploy via Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Find your project
3. Click "Redeploy" to trigger a new build with the `vercel.json` config

### Option 2: Deploy from CLI
```bash
# Make sure you're in the web directory
cd hotelrateintel-web

# Install Vercel CLI if you haven't
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel --prod
```

### Option 3: Push to Git (if connected)
```bash
# Add the new vercel.json file
git add vercel.json
git commit -m "Add Vercel configuration to fix routing 404s"
git push origin main
```

## âœ… Expected Results After Fix

**Routes that should work:**
- `/` - Redirects to dashboard
- `/dashboard` - Main dashboard with collapsible nav & time periods
- `/hotels` - Hotel management
- `/rates` - Rate analysis
- `/alerts` - Alert management

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

If you still see 404s:
1. Check Vercel build logs for errors
2. Ensure the build completed successfully
3. Verify the domain is pointing to the latest deployment
