## üöß Development Phases

### Phase 1 ‚Äî MVP (Next Few Days)
- Web dashboard with:
  - Rate scraping for a few OTAs
  - Manual hotel/competitor input
  - Trend graph + simple forecasting
  - Custom filters
  - Basic alerts
- Mobile app with:
  - Summary dashboard
  - Manual refresh
  - Push alerts

### Phase 2 ‚Äî Stability & Usability
- UX refinements
- Saved views
- Automated daily data refresh
- Occupancy and demand forecasting improvements

### Phase 3 ‚Äî Scale & Integrate
- Add more OTAs / refine scraping
- SSO, GDPR, audit logs
- API integrations with hotel PMS or CRS
- Monetization system (plans, billing, subscriptions)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Challenges & Solutions
| Challenge | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| OTA scraping can break often | Use modular scrapers with fallback plans; rotate proxies; plan for eventual API partnerships |
| GDPR compliance at scale | Minimize personal data; include clear user consent flows |
| High data volume & performance | Use caching and async background scraping; scalable cloud infra |
| Custom filters = complex UI | Invest in flexible filter builder and preset templates |

## üöÄ Future Expansion Possibilities
- Integration with hotel Property Management Systems (PMS)
- API access for hotel groups
- AI-based pricing recommendations
- Geographic heat maps for demand trends
- Competitive benchmarking tools across markets
- Language localization for global expansion
